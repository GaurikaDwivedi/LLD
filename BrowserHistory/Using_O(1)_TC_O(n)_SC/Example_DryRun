Initialization:
An instance of the BrowserHistory class is created with the homepage URL "https://www.example.com".
The initial state includes a list visitedWebpages with the homepage, currentIndex set to 0, and currentHistorySize set to 1.
browser = BrowserHistory("https://www.example.com")


Visiting URLs:
URLs "https://www.example.com/page1", "https://www.example.com/page2", and "https://www.example.com/page3" are visited using the visit method.
The visit method increments the currentIndex, updates or inserts the URL at the current index in visitedWebpages, and updates currentHistorySize.
browser.visit("https://www.example.com/page1")
browser.visit("https://www.example.com/page2")
browser.visit("https://www.example.com/page3")


The state after these visits is as follows:
   [home] <-> [page3] <-> [page2] <-> [page1] -> None
    ^         ^         ^         ^
    |         |         |         |
  head     current    prev      prev

Backward Navigation (browser.back(2)):
The back method is called with a parameter of 2, indicating a backward navigation of 2 steps.
The currentIndex is updated to the maximum of 0 and the current index minus 2.
The URL at the updated index (in this case, index 1) is returned.

print("Current URL:", browser.back(2))  # Output: https://www.example.com/page1
